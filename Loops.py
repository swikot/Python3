#1 Count-controlled loops
# for (i=0; i <= n; i++)
# Python doesn't know this kind of loop.

#2 Condition-controlled loop
# A loop will be repeated until a given condition changes
# There are while loops and do while loops with this behaviour.

# 3Collection-controlled loop
# This is a special construct which allow looping through the elements of a "collection"
#  which can be an array, list or other ordered sequence.

# Python supplies two different kinds of loops:
# the while loop and the for loop,
# which correspond to the condition-controlled loop and collection-controlled loop.
