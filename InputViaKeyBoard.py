# The input of the user will be returned as a string without any changes
# If this raw input has to be transformed into
# another data type needed by
# the algorithm, we can use either
# a casting function or the eval function.

# name=input("give me some input")
# print("your output= :",name," ",type(name))
# name1=eval(input("Input me something !!!"))
# print("your output= :",name1,type(name1))
# population=input("input me some thing !!! :")
# print("population",population," ",type(population))
population=eval(input("give me some population!!"))
print("population",population," ",type(population))



#  in python 3 i have to use only input() or eval(input())
